# Node-React-ReactRouter-Redux-Express Starter

This is a template so that others can set up a React-Redux application and connect to an Express backend.

This was inspired by [Eli Badgio](https://github.com/ebadgio) template.

## Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**
   - Command: `npm install`

2) **Webpack build**
   - During development: `npm run build`
   - For production: `npm run prod`

3. **Start the server**
   - Command: `npm run server`
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and you should see a navbar and a home page.
